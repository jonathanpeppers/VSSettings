# VSSettings
Code formatting settings for various projects

# VS 2017 on Windows

Use the import/export wizard thingy on the `*.vssettings` files.

# VS for Mac

You can place the file in `~/Library/VisualStudio/7.0/Policies/UserDefault.mdpolicy.xml` manually. But make sure to close VS for Mac first!

You can also run:
```
./switch.sh Embeddinator-4000
```
Or:
```
./switch.sh Xamarin.Android
```

This will close VS for Mac, move the file, and reopen it.
